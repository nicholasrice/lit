## Unreleased

### Changed

- Errors that occur during the update cycle were previously squelched to allow subsequent updates to proceed normally. Now errors are re-fired asynchronously so they can be detected. Errors can be observed via an `unhandledrejection` event handler on window.

### Added

- Lifecycle callbacks added for connected, disconnected, update, and updated. To use, simply add callback functions to the appropriate callbacks set: `connectedCallbacks`, `disconnectedCallbacks`, `updateCallbacks`, or `updatedCallbacks`.

- UpdatingElement moved from `lit-element` package to `updating-element` package.

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue with `queryAssignedNodes` when applying a selector on a slot that included text nodes on older browsers not supporting Element.matches [#1088](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element/issues/1088).
